= What the message " Warning: http://somelink is unreachable. " Means?
It mean's that Facebook can't find the page you're trying to use the SEO Facebook Comment. The reasons that could possibly lead to this are:
* You haven't correctly configured the APP ID or APP SECRET
* Facebook can't find the Host/Link of your page (using a LOCAL SERVER for example)
* You didn't correctly configured all the necessary options in the http://facebook.com/developers page
